Long-Term Sea Surface Temperature and Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall Dataset
This dataset consists of the Sea Surface Temperature (ERSSTv5; 2째 x 2째) Anomalies and the June-July-August-September averaged annual rainfall over India (IMD; 1째 x 1째) over 120 years starting from 1901 to 2020.
The SST data has been cleaned of the seasonal cycle and the trend at each grid point, thus isolating the inter-annual variability.
